Initial GLM gives me pretty mediocre results:
          Reference
Prediction    0    1
         0 2605  140
         1  114   31

AUC: 0.5814

That's significantly worse AUC than if you just guess that it isn't fraud for every case, but it means that 21% of the "positives" are fraud, compared to only 5% of the "negatives".
So if you were trying to pick out claims to investigate for fraud, this GLM would help considerably to improve your search odds. Maybe AUC isn't the best metric for fraud detection?
